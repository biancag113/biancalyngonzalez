      <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a full-stack developer and designer currently quarantining in San Francisco, California.
                I began my career as a nurse and later worked for tech companies in the healthcare space.
                I first learned how to code by building high fidelity MVP's, web apps, and wearable devices for the companies I worked with.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy building cutting edge technology to solve the most challenging problems in healthcare and beyond. 
                Using multiple programming languages and frameworks, I have helped companies and individuals make their ideas into reality.
            </p>
